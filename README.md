# Service2ServiceCommunication

• Implemented service-to-service communication in Spring Boot using RestTemplate.

• Enabled one microservice to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to another service.

• Configured the RestTemplate bean in the application context for reuse.

• Utilized RestTemplate to consume REST endpoints exposed by other services.

• Supported synchronous communication between microservices.

• Ensured clear and structured data exchange across distributed components.
